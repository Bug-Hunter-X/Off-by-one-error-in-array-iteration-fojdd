This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating an off-by-one error in array iteration. The `Bug.java` file contains the buggy code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code with the appropriate loop condition to avoid the error. This example highlights the importance of careful loop indexing and proper array boundary checks in programming.
